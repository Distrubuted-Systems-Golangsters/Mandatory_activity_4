## How to run the program:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Start peer1 node (In terminal):**

- go run main.go peer1 :6000

3. **Start peer2 node (In a different terminal):**

- go run main.go peer2 :6001

4. **Start peer3 node (In a different terminal):**

- go run main.go peer3 :6002

5. **Note it is important that the peers name and port follow these exact names and that all three peers are started before continuing to the next step**
